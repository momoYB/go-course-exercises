# Hands on Exercise #5

Create _square_ and _circle_ `struct`

Attach an _area `method`_ to each `struct`
* circle area = _Ï€\*R\*R_
* square area = _L\*L_

Create a type _shape_ that defines an `interface` as anything that has the _area `method`_.

Create a `func` _info_ which takes a _shape_ and prints it's _area_.

Create a _value_ of type _square_ and _circle_ and use the _info_ `func` to print their area.
