# Hands-on Exercise #5  

Building on the code from the [previous example](https://github.com/momoYB/go-course-exercises/blob/master/Exercises%20-%20Ninja%20Level%201/Hands-on%20exercise%20%234/main.go)  

At the package level scope, using the `var` keyword, create a VARIABLE with the IDENTIFIER `y`. The variable should be of the UNDERLYING TYPE of your custom type `x`.

In `func main`:
   * This should already be done from the previous exercise:
      - *print out the value of the variable `x`.*
      - *print out the type of the variable `x`.*
      - *assign your own VALUE to the VARIABLE `x` using the `=` OPERATOR.*
      - *print out the value of the variable `x`.*
   * Now do this:
      - use CONVERSION to convert the TYPE of the VALUE stored in `x` to the UNDERLYING TYPE.
      - use the `=` operator to ASSIGN that value to `y`.
      - print out the value stored in `y`.
      - print out the type of `y`.
